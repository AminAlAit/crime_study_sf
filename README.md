Quantitative analyses can have a significant impact on initiating change within one's community. When analyzed responsibly, data can provide evidence to understand difficult social issues correctly. In this project, you will leverage publicly available data to interpret crime patterns within the city of San Francisco.

The dataset used in this project is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/san-francisco/sf-police-calls-for-service-and-incidents) and updated daily. 
Note: some of the original column names are altered for adherence to a standard naming scheme.

In this notebook, I will be using the following packages: 
1. lubridate
2. tidyverse
3. ggplot2
4. ggmap
